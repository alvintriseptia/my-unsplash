I Built my unsplash site by following challenge from devchallenges.io. You can look my site here [My Unsplash](https://alvindev-myunsplash.herokuapp.com/). From this challenge, I have learned about Mansory Layout, delete an image, and how to search an image by label. I think my solution is not optimal, so I hope you all can give me some feedback about my solution :)
